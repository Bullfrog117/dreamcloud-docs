Share a tutorial on how to run applications on DreamHost Cloud and get
your monthly bill reduced by $100! Chances are your bill will go to
$0: sweet deal!

We’ll give you a $100 discount for any DreamHost Cloud product
(DreamCompute, DreamObjects or DreamSpeed) for each pull request
merged in a month. That's enough to run 4 servers with 4GB of RAM and 2
vCPU each or allocate an additional 1TB of block storage for a month!

Read all the details below and start writing!

Submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~
You’ll get one free month (up to $100) for DreamCompute, DreamObjects, or
DreamSpeed for your properly-submitted documentation into the Bounty
Program. To receive this credit, you must submit a support ticket through
your account whenever you have a pending charge for either DreamCompute
or DreamObjects.

Your support ticket must provide us with a link to the merged commit on github.

Minimum Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We kindly ask that your submissions are a minimum of 250 words in length.

Payment Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once our Technical Support team receives your support ticket with a proper
github link, we will cancel the current month’s outstanding DreamCompute or
DreamObjects charges (up to $100)!


Please note that credits are only applicable to one charge for that specific
month during which you submitted your support ticket, and won’t be applicable
to both services at the same time. Credits won’t stack based on multiple
services or multiple submissions.

There is a limit of one single cancellation per month. You can submit as many
contributions to the program as you’d like (and we encourage you to!), but you
won’t receive multiple service credits in a single month. Also, the credits
won’t be treated as rollovers for the next month; you’re limited to a single
credit in a single month!
