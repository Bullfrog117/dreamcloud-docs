How does hourly billing work?
-----------------------------

We bill you for each virtual server per hour of usage until
reaching the monthly price, at which the cost is capped for the month.

When is a virtual server considered running?

Billing stops for a virtual server once it is deleted/terminated.

How much do IPs cost?
---------------------

In US-East 2 virtual servers receive a public IPv4 and IPv6 address by default.
The best part is that there is no additional charge!

How much does block storage cost?
---------------------------------

Each DreamCompute cluster includes 100 GB of block storage at no charge. You
can adjust your monthly allotment of block storage by purchasing additional
100GB chunks.

Monthly pricing for the 100 GB chunks in US-East 2 is $10.00/month.

Pricing for block storage is based on the total monthly allotment rather than
the amount used.

Is private networking available in US-East 2?
---------------------------------------------

Private networking is coming soon to US-East 2 with improvements based on the
feedback we received. We will allow you to add multiple networks at $5 each
per month. `Let us know if you'd like to trial this feature in US-East 2 at no
